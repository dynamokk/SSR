Server Side Rendering SSR

The clientâ€“server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.
So, we have client, server and connection between client and server. 

Historical first we had Server side rendering, but client became thicker and thicker and the connection was the thickest place in this architecture. 
The client side rendering was the most popular and the most performace.
But client side is not good approch for weakless browsers.
